# Markdown Formatting

Formatting text with markdown is very simple.
The idea is that some characters, positioned at specific locations or wrapped around words, are transformed into instructions how the output should look like.
Additionally, normal HTML tags can be added, too.

On the right hand side you can see a real-time preview of the rendered document.
